# Altera Board Renderer

Renders a series of bits generated by verilog / ModelSim to be displayed on a virtual altera development Board. The board has 2 components: Six 7-Segment displays and 10 LEDs. Here is an example of a virtual Board, as well as the binary string that represents it. Each of the components having the most significant bit/7-seg on the left:

    ....... ####### ....... #.....# ####### #######
    .     . .     # .     . #     # #     # .     #
    .     . .     # .     . #     # #     # .     #
    .     . .     # .     . #     # #     # .     #
    ....... ####### ....... ####### #.....# ......#
    .     . .     # .     . .     # #     # .     #
    .     . .     # .     . .     # #     # .     #
    .     . .     # .     . .     # #     # .     #
    ....... ####### ....... ......# ####### ......#

    1111111 0110000 1111111 0011001 1000000 1111000 0011110100

The 7-Segment displays are active low and the LEDs are active high, so this can be seen in the relationship between the bits and the `'.'` / `'#'`, with `#` representing 'on'. Note that the 7-segment display strings are 7 bits long while the led component is 10 bits long.

The bits of the 7-Segment display are ordered as follows (with 0 being the LSB):

    +--0--+
    |     |
    5     1
    |     |
    +--6--+
    |     |
    4     2
    |     |
    +--3--+

# Usage
To render the board, run `python3 main.py FILENAME`, where filename is the name of the file with the output of your Verilog code. The renderer is designed to output multiple renderings over different lines. 

Inside the file, lines can be 'commented out' with `#` at the start of the line (to match ModelSim). This value is stored in `IGNORE_CHAR` in main.py. A line can also be marked as a 'caption' to be printed straight to the output with `@`. It's useful for annotating things in the middle of a simulation such as "button pressed". The value is stored in `CAPTION_CHAR` in main.py.

Inside Verilog, the display command to get the board bitstring following the naming convention in the boilerplate should look like:

    $display("%b %b %b %b %b %b %b", HEX5, HEX4, HEX3, HEX2, HEX1, HEX0, LEDR);

# Boilerplate
An example wrapper is located in `boilerplate.v`. It contains boilerplate for the board as well as the seven segment display module and an example test bench.
